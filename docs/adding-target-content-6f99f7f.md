# Adding Target Content

Administrators add target content in order to preview any changes they make to the theme.



## Prerequisites

You have selected a theme as the base of your theme.

See [Creating a New Theme](creating-a-new-theme-f987d5f.md).



## Context

Once you have selected a theme, you can preview any changes you make to it. By adding target content \(pages and apps\) can see how the changes you make look in different UI technologies \(for example, SAP Fiori launchpad\).

The previews available in the *Add Target Content* section depend on the base theme that you select. Only preview pages for UI technologies that support the selected base theme are displayed.



## Procedure

1.  Choose sample content for the preview.

    You can add the following content:

    -   SAP application preview pages:

        Here you can find sample applications based on different UI technologies \(for example, SAP Fiori launchpad\).

        > ### Note:  
        > The SAP Fiori launchpad is the current default preview page.

    -   SAP control preview pages:

        Here you can find sample pages related to a specific control.

    -   Custom applications:

        Here you can add custom SAPUI5 applications as target content for the preview. For more information, see [Adding Custom SAPUI5 Applications as Target Content](adding-custom-sapui5-applications-as-target-content-8d5aa0f.md).


2.  To add more than one application, choose ![Add Target Content](images/Add_Target_Content_03577f6.png). The *Add Target Content* dialog box appears again and you can choose the application you want to add.

    The applications you have added appear in the *Target Pages* pane and can be selected to be displayed in the preview area.

    Choose ![Expand Preview to Full Width](images/Expand_Preview_to_Full_Width_c392caa.png) to expand the preview to full width.

    Use the *Original/Preview* toggle button to switch between the original theme and the preview of the current version of your theme.




## Next Steps

You can now change the values of theming parameters or add CSS rules. The application preview is automatically adjusted once you've made a change.
