## Procedure

1.  Log on to your subaccount in SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to *Services*.

3.  Use the search bar or select *User Experience* in the category dropdown list to find the *Portal* tile.

4.  Click the *Portal* tile and then *Go to Service*.

5.  Click *Site Directory* to see a list of sites in your subaccount.

6.  Select the site that you want to brand with your theme and click *Edit*.

7.  Select *Services and Tools* in the side navigation panel.

8.  Click the *UI Theme Designer* tile.

    > ### Note:  
    > The SAPUI5 version of the theme used by the UI theme designer is the same as that used by the SAP Fiori launchpad.
