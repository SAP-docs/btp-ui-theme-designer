If you want to theme specific controls and change more parameters than the quick theming offers, you can use the detailed theming.



<a name="copy75653b29885e4101914b96277729211e__prereq_e2m_43g_zhb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have selected a theme as the base of your theme and an application for the preview.

> ### Restriction:  
> Detailed theming is only available for the SAP Quartz Light and SAP Quartz Dark theme.



## Context

Detailed theming allows you to make more changes to your theme than the basic parameters. The parameters are grouped in meaningful categories by controls and/or areas or semantics. They are labelled with a descriptive text.



## Procedure

1.  On top of the panel on the right, choose *Detailed*.

2.  Change the parameter values according to your needs.

    The preview is automatically adjusted once you have selected a new value.
