# What's New in UI Theme Designer 1.20

Compared to version 1.16, UI theme designer 1.20 contains a list of new and changed features.



## Create Custom Themes Based on SAP Belize \(New\)

A new SAP standard theme, SAP Belize, can be used to create custom themes for SAPUI5 and Unified Rendering technologies. The calm color tones help users to stay focused on daily business content. With clean and consistent layouts throughout the UI, SAP Belize conveys the content with clarity. Delightful details in microinteractions and typography are being added to make the Fiori user experience richer. For a list of restrictions, see SAP Note [2337350](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2337350).



## Create Custom Themes Based on SAP Blue Crystal for SAPUI5 Applications \(Deprecated\)

The theme SAP Blue Crystal is deprecated for SAPUI5 applications as of version 1.40. Therefore, custom themes based on SAP Blue Crystal need to be migrated to SAP Belize.

See SAP Note [2329884](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2329884).



## Quick Theming \(Changed\)

The *Quick* tab has been redesigned to allow you to create themes even faster and easier. This tab now offers more parameters and the parameters are grouped more clearly guiding you through the theming process. For example, you can find the most important parameters that can be used to theme a specific control in one section.

See [Changing the Main Parameters Using Quick Theming](Create-Themes/changing-the-main-parameters-using-quick-theming-e4d2a95.md)

A new preview page *QuickTheming* is available for Unified Rendering. It shows the most important controls which are affected by changes in the *Quick* tab.



## UI Design \(Changed\)

As part of an enhancement to the UI theme designer appearance, you can now enjoy a new UI design.



## Usability Improvements for the Start Screen \(New\)

The start screen has been redesigned to improve usability. The following changes are available:

-   The *Filter Themes* pane was replaced by a search field. Simply enter search terms to filter the theme list.

-   The following information has been added to the table displaying the list of available themes:

    -   Status

    -   Vendor

    -   Based On


-   The start screen now gives you an idea of what a selected theme looks like: When you select a theme in the list, its main colors are displayed as a preview.

-   Responsiveness was improved. For example, the theme list and the area with theme properties are displayed as separate tabs when there is not enough space on the screen.

-   The order in which buttons appear was changed.
