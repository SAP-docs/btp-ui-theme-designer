# Data Protection

Things you should know about personal data and other non-public data when creating custom themes.

In the UI theme designer, you can upload arbitrary files into custom themes.

Custom themes must not contain any personal data or any other data that should not be exposed to the public.

Any authenticated user can access files of the custom themes.
