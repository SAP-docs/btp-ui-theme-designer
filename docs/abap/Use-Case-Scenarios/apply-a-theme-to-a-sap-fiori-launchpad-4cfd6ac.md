# Apply a Theme to a SAP Fiori Launchpad

Administrators can assign themes to an SAP Fiori launchpad.

You can apply a theme that you created in the UI theme designer to an SAP Fiori launchpad site by exporting it from the UI theme designer and manually importing it into the Portal Theme Manager. From the Theme Manager, you can assign your theme to your launchpad site.
