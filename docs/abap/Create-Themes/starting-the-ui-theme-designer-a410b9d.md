# Starting the UI Theme Designer

Administrators start the UI Theme Designer in an on premise environment by using a transaction code.

To start the UI theme designer, use transaction code `/UI5/THEME_DESIGNER` in your ABAP back-end system.

You can then bookmark the URL in your browser and start it from there without having to log in via SAP GUI.
