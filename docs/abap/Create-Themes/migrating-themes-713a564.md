# Migrating Themes

Here's how you can migrate custom themes.



<a name="loio713a564049dd456d9c5954b791f040de__section_iwy_fxm_rrb"/>

## Prerequisite

You have created a theme.

See [Creating a New Theme](creating-a-new-theme-f987d5f.md).



<a name="loio713a564049dd456d9c5954b791f040de__section_swp_gxm_rrb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Start the UI theme designer.

2.  On the welcome screen, select the custom theme you want to migrate. If you have several custom themes, you can use the search field to locate one.

3.  Choose *Migrate*.

4.  Provide a new *Theme ID* and a *Title*.

5.  For *Based On*, select the SAP standard theme that you want to use as the basis for the migrated theme.

6.  Confirm with *Migrate*.


The selected theme will now be saved as a copy with the name you entered based on the SAP standard theme you selected. You can change both themes independent of each other.

> ### Note:  
> Migration will keep as many of your changes as possible, such as changed parameters or uploaded resources like a logo. However, there will be cases where the result is not 100% correct. Revisit the migration result and use it as a starting point for manual fine-tuning.
