# Adding Test Suites for Preview Purposes

UI theme designer comes with a predefined set of preview pages for various SAP UI technologies, for example, SAPUI5 and Unified Rendering. The available preview pages are provided in test suites for control-specific previews, and pages to simulate applications.

## Context

The preview pages are separated for each SAP UI technology. The set of test suites available depends on the SAP base theme you have selected. Not all UI technologies support each SAP theme.

You can select from the predefined set of preview pages depending on your theming scope. The following table aims to help you with the selection process:
