# Adding Preview Pages

Administrators can add preview pages to the UI theme designer editor to preview changes they make to a theme. UI theme designer comes with a set of predefined preview pages for various SAP UI technologies.

## Context

Once you have selected a theme for editing, you can preview your changes using different preview pages. When you start UI theme designer for the first time, a default selection of preview pages is displayed. In general, this is the SAP Fiori Launchpad page. Depending on your needs, you can select further preview pages from the set of predefined preview pages or add your own applications to the preview pages pane.

Predefined preview pages are available for various SAP UI technologies, for example, SAPUI5 and Unified Rendering. The available preview pages are provided in test suites. Test suites are available for control-specific previews and pages to simulate applications. There are separate preview pages for each SAP UI technology.
