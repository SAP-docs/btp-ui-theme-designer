# What's New in UI Theme Designer 1.22

In the following sections, we list the main new features and enhancements in UI Theme Designer for software component SAP\_UI 751 SP01 \(UI Theme Designer version 1.22\).



## New Welcome Screen

UI Theme Designer presents you with a new welcome screen that can be divided into the following sections:

-   Top section

    This section is for the display of action buttons, such as those for **creating a new theme**.

-   Lower section

    This section is divided into the following areas by a movable splitter bar:

    -   Left side

        This side is for **managing** your own custom themes. Here, you can search for and edit your theme. Additionally, you can rebuild, duplicate and delete themes.

    -   Right side

        This side is for viewing and editing the **properties** of your selected custom theme.


    Note that only your custom themes, and no SAP themes, are displayed on the welcome screen.
