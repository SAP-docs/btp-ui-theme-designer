## Context

Usually invalidation is automatic when a new Unified Rendering, SAPUI5 version, or a changed custom theme is detected. If you think for some reason this hasn't happened, invalidate the service cache as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Start the *Tool for Customer Themes Maintenance* using transaction `/UI5/THEME_TOOL`.

2.  Select *Invalidate Cache* and choose ![Choose (F2)](../Use-Case-Scenarios/images/Choose_F2_54818e9.png).
