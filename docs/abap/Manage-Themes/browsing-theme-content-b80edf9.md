# Browsing Theme Content

To analyze theme content, you use the theme repository browser.



## Context

The theme repository browser allows you to access the theming files that are exposed in a directory structure called the theme root.

> ### Note:  
> Do not change any theming files using the theme repository browser.



## Procedure

1.  To open the theme repository browser, use the following path:

    `https://<hostname>[:<port>]/sap/bc/theming/themes/~client-<client>`

    Example: `https://myserver.com/sap/bc/theming/themes/~client-020`

2.  Navigate to the folder in which the CSS files for your theme are stored.
