# Get Started

Using UI theme designer administrators can create their own themes to adapt the visual appearance of applications.

**One single tool for theming and branding SAPâ€™s key user interfaces**

Apply your corporate branding to applications built with SAP UI technologies. The UI theme designer is a browser-based tool for cross-theming scenarios. Use it to easily build your corporate identity themes by modifying one of the theme templates provided by SAP. For example, you can change the color scheme, or add your company's logo. The tool is targeted at different user groups, including developers, visual designers, and administrators.

To get an impression of how UI theme designer helps you provide a seamless and delightful experience for your users across different UI technologies, watch this video:
