    In the Welcome screen, the build-status message that appears in the details view of the *Themes* section, when a theme is selected, has been updated to include the following build-statuses:

    -   *Theme needs to be rebuilt. Show Details \(Link\)*

        This message is displayed when a change that has occurred in the system requires the theme to be rebuilt, for example, when you have implemented a patch for the rendering of one of the supported UI technologies. The *Show Details* link displays a dialog box detailing what has occurred in the system.

    -   *Theme has been built with errors. Show Details \(Link\)*

        This message is displayed when a theme has been successfully built although it contains errors. The *Show Details* link displays a dialog box detailing those errors.
