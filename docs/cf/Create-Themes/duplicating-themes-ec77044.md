# Duplicating Themes

You can duplicate custom themes that are displayed in the theme list.



<a name="loioec77044b20ba4888a1d8de474f76a040__section_tjl_bzm_rrb"/>

## Prerequisite

You have created a theme.

See [Creating a New Theme](creating-a-new-theme-72c730b.md).



<a name="loioec77044b20ba4888a1d8de474f76a040__section_dd1_czm_rrb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Start the UI theme designer.

2.  In the welcome screen, select the custom theme you want to duplicate. If you have several custom themes, you can use the search field to locate one.

3.  Select *Duplicate*.

4.  Provide a new *Theme ID*, a *Title* and \(if needed\) other meta information about the theme.

5.  Confirm with *Duplicate*.

6.  The selected theme will now be saved as a copy with the name you gave it. You can change both themes independent of each other.


You can also create a copy of an existing custom theme if you open it for editing and choose *Theme* \> *Save As*. This way, you save the current state of an edited theme with a new name.
