# Working with Preview Pages

With preview pages added to the UI theme designer editor, you can see what the custom theme looks like before you publish it. In addition to changing the theming parameters, you can also change the appearance of the preview page.

## Prerequisite

-   You have added preview pages and selected one of them. For more information, see [Adding Preview Pages](adding-preview-pages-8af60d3.md).

## Context

When editing a theme, the screen is divided into three areas:

-   In the *Preview Pages pane* on the left, you see the selected preview pages \(see [Adding Preview Pages](adding-preview-pages-8af60d3.md)\).

-   In the *Editor pane* on the right, you see the theming parameters, which can be changed \(see the other subtopics of [Editing Themes](editing-themes-9766329.md)\).

-   The *Preview pane* in the middle, displays the selected preview page.


You can resize the areas by dragging the dividers.

In top left of the *Preview pane*, there are two buttons to switch between the original \(SAP\) theme and the preview of the current status of your custom theme. This way you can see the differences between your custom theme and the SAP theme, which is used as a basis.

In the top right of the Preview pane there are different buttons:

-   A button to reload the display

-   A button to enlarge the *Preview pane* to full width by hiding the list of preview pages pane and the *Editor pane*. If you have enlarged the *Preview pane* this way, you can reduce it again to the normal appearance by clicking the button again.

-   Three buttons to display the *Preview pane* as it appears on a desktop, on a mobile phone, and on a tablet. If you display the *Preview pane* as it appears on a mobile phone or on a tablet two more buttons appear to switch the orientation of the page \(landscape vs. portrait\).
