# Adjusting Parameters Using Detailed Theming

If you want to theme specific controls and change more parameters than the quick theming offers, you can use the detailed theming.



<a name="loiodb09bb96b1304c50a31978a48ed11506__prereq_e2m_43g_zhb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have created a theme or selected an existing one and opened it for editing. For more information, see [Creating a New Theme](creating-a-new-theme-72c730b.md).

-   You have added preview pages and selected one of them. For more information, see [Adding Preview Pages](adding-preview-pages-8af60d3.md).


> ### Restriction:  
> Detailed theming is only available for the SAP Quartz Light and SAP Quartz Dark theme.



## Context

Detailed theming allows you to make more changes to your theme than the basic parameters. The parameters are grouped in meaningful categories by controls and/or areas or semantics. They are labelled with a descriptive text.



## Procedure

1.  On top of the panel on the right, choose *Detailed*.

2.  Change the parameter values according to your needs.

    The preview is automatically adjusted once you have selected a new value.
