# Publishing Themes

Administrators publish their themes to make them available for use. Only published themes are available in the Theme Manager of SAP Build Work Zone or can be applied to applications. Any time you make changes to the theme, you'll need to publish it again to make those changes available. The theme manager is only relevant if you use SAP Build Work Zone. Other scenarios may require different theming tools.



## Procedure

1.  In the welcome screen, select the theme you want to publish.

    A theme can have one of the following statuses:

    -   *Never Published*

        The theme has been saved but has never been published.

    -   *Published*

        The theme has been published successfully.

    -   *Modified*

        The theme has been published and registered with the Theme Manager. if you make more changes to the published theme, you need to publish the theme again.


2.  To publish your theme, click on *Publish*. Alternatively, you can go to *Theme* \> *Save and Publish* in the editor.
