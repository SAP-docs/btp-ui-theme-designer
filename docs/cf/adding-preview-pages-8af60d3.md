# Adding Preview Pages

Administrators or other theme developers can add preview pages to the UI theme designer editor to preview changes they make to a theme. UI theme designer comes with a set of predefined preview pages for various SAP UI technologies.

## Context

Once you have selected a theme for editing, you can preview your changes using different preview pages. When you start UI theme designer for the first time, a default selection of preview pages is displayed. In general, this is the SAP Fiori Launchpad page. Depending on your needs, you can select further pages from the set of predefined preview pages or add your own applications to the *Preview Pages* pane.

Predefined preview pages are available for various SAP UI technologies, for example, SAPUI5 and Unified Rendering. The available preview pages are provided in test suites. Test suites are available for control-specific previews and pages to simulate applications. There are separate preview pages for each SAP UI technology.

## Procedure

1.  Select *Add Preview Pages* to add or remove preview pages. If you have already selected preview pages of a test suite, you can also click the test suite in the *Preview Pages* pane to open the preview pages configuration screen.

2.  Add an application or select from the list of test suites to add your required preview pages.

    These options are described in more detail in separate topics in this section.

3.  Select your new preview page. Click the *Original/Preview* toggle button \(in the toolbar at the top of the page\) to switch between the preview and the original SAP theme. For more information, see [Working with Preview Pages](working-with-preview-pages-8988483.md).
