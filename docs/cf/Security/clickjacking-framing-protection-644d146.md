# Clickjacking Framing Protection

Clickjacking is an attempt to trick users into clicking hidden or masked user interface elements without the user realizing it. Users think they are clicking the underlying element in the presented context, but they are actually clicking an action chosen by the attacker.

To prevent malicious applications from using the UI theme designer UI for clickjacking attacks, clickjacking framing protection is enabled by default.

Clickjacking framing protection prevents the UI theme designer from being loaded in a frame when the parent runs on a different host.
