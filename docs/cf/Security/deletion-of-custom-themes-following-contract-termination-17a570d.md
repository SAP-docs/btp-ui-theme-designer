# Deletion of Custom Themes Following Contract Termination

Custom themes are deleted when an SAP BTP contract is terminated.

After all subscriptions of an subaccount to applications using theming are deleted, the custom themes of this account will be deleted.

Note that termination of the UI theme designer or Cloud Portal services does not delete the themes.
