# Transport Using Export and Import Functionality in UI Theme Designer

You can create themes in one system and use them in other systems and platforms.

Some examples are:

-   Transport themes from a test system to a production system.

-   Transport themes from your SAP BTP subaccount and export it to your on premise system.

-   Transport themes from your on premise system to your cloud system.


The overall process is as follows:

1.  Create a theme in the UI theme designer.

    For more information, see [Create Themes â€” End to End Flow](../create-themes-end-to-end-flow-0d2d662.md).

2.  Export the theme to your local hard disk.

    For more information, see [Exporting Themes](../exporting-themes-26e5140.md).

3.  Import themes as an archive file from your local hard disk to the UI theme designer.

    For more information, see [Importing Themes](../importing-themes-5e3c430.md).
