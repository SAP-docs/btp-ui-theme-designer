# Editing Themes

Administrators can edit themes which have been created within or imported into UI theme designer.



## Context

You can change the values of the theming parameters, add images, change colors, and more. To edit an existing custom theme, simply select a theme that you have created or imported into the UI theme designer. Then choose *Edit* or double click it.

> ### Note:  
> There is currently no mechanism to notify you when a custom theme is edited by several users at once.
> 
> To avoid changes to a theme being overwritten, you need to make sure that no other user is editing the theme you want to work on.
