# Cloud Mode

The UI theme designer is launched in *Cloud* mode by default.

When you save your theme, it is saved as an HTML5 application in your Cloud subaccount.

In the details view of the *Themes* section, the property *Status* displays the following information:

-   *Never Published*

    Displayed after you save a theme for the first time.

-   *Modified*

    Displayed after you edit a published theme. The changes are not displayed in the application until you publish the theme again and maintain the theme in the Theme Manager.

-   *Published*

    Displayed after you publish a theme.

    Once you click the *Publish* button \(and the status message displays *Published*\), the theme is registered automatically with the Theme Manager\*. The Theme Manager allows administrators to make the theme available for use in the application.

    The version of the published theme is the one that is used by the application.


> ### Note:  
> \* Themes published in the UI theme designer are only registered automatically with the Theme Manager if you opened the UI theme designer via the SAP Fiori launchpad configuration cockpit. If you opened the UI theme designer via the SAP BTP cockpit, there is no direct connection with the Theme Manager.
