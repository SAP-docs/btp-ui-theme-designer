# Create Theme Sets

You can create theme sets to define light, dark, and high‑contrast appearance for your theme.

This section covers the steps to create, import, publish, export, rename, and duplicate theme sets, so you can maintain coordinated appearance variants.

> ### Restriction:  
> SAP Fiori Launchpad can only work with theme sets where each theme is assigned to a single theme set. For more information, see [SAP Fiori Launchpad: Themes](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/a7b390faab1140c087b8926571e942b7/f30f13573623477cb66255770aabcf51.html).
