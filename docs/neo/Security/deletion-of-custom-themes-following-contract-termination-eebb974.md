# Deletion of Custom Themes Following Contract Termination

Custom themes are deleted when an SAP BTP contract is terminated.

When an SAP BTP contract is terminated, the custom themes associated with them are also deleted - including any user-related information.

Note that termination of the UI theme designer or Cloud Portal services does not delete the themes.

If you want to delete your subaccount, you will need to manually delete the themes using the *Delete* button in UI theme designer or delete the application in the *HTML5 Applications* page of the SAP BTP Cockpit.

For the latter you will also need to check the option 'Delete corresponding repository <â€¦\>'.
