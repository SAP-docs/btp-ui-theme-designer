# Adding Custom SAPUI5 Applications as Target Content

To use custom SAPUI5 apps as target content for the preview, you need to start the UI theme designer via the host of the custom application.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> Applications you want to use as target content need to run on the same host as the UI theme designer application.

You add target pages to your theme when you create a theme in the UI theme designer.

-   If you accessed the UI theme designer from SAP BTP, do the following:

    From the *Add Target Pages* screen, In the *Link to Application* field, enter a link in this format: `/doorway/<applicationName>`.

-   If you accessed the UI theme designer from the Portal, do the following:

    From the *Add Target Pages* screen, in the *Link to Application* field, enter the URL of the runtime site. You can get this URL from the site's tile in the Portal Site Directory.
