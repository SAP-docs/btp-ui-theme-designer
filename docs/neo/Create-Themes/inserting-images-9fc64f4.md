## Procedure

1.  Decide which image you want to change. In Expert Theming you can choose ![Show Images Only](images/Show_Images_Only_fdbb8a4.png) to display parameters referring only to images.

2.  Select the button to the right of the input field with the value for the relevant parameter.

3.  Drag and drop an image file from your local files to the *Assign Image* dialog box or click in the box to call up a file browser. If you know the URL of the image you want to use, you can also specify this as the value of the input field.

    Within this dialog box you can also select images already uploaded and you can delete uploaded images if they are not needed anymore. If you donâ€™t want to use any of the suggested images, you can click on the *Do not use image* picture.

4.  Confirm the dialog box.
