# Adjusting Parameters Using Detailed Theming

If you want to theme specific controls and change more parameters than the quick theming offers, you can use the detailed theming.

## Prerequisites

-   You have created a theme or selected an existing one and opened it for editing. For more information, see [Creating a New Theme](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09f6818d8e064537973102d6289e2aca/Cloud/en-US/72c730b60f6b41b0bfed63b474007b51.html "Administrators create themes using the Create a New Theme wizard in the UI theme designer.") :arrow_upper_right:.

-   You have added preview pages and selected one of them. For more information, see [Adding Preview Pages](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09f6818d8e064537973102d6289e2aca/Cloud/en-US/8af60d39007a4847919f8dcbbb7a7b16.html "Administrators or other theme developers can add preview pages to the UI theme designer editor to preview changes they make to a theme. UI theme designer comes with a set of predefined preview pages for various SAP UI technologies.") :arrow_upper_right:.


> ### Restriction:  
> Detailed theming is only available for the SAP Quartz Light and SAP Quartz Dark theme.



## Context

Detailed theming allows you to make more changes to your theme than the basic parameters. The parameters are grouped in meaningful categories by controls and/or areas or semantics. They are labelled with a descriptive text.



## Procedure

1.  On top of the panel on the right, choose *Detailed*.

2.  Change the parameter values according to your needs.

    The preview is automatically adjusted once you have selected a new value.
