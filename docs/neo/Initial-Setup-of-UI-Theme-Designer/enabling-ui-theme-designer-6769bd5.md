# Enabling UI Theme Designer

Before using the UI theme designer, administrators must ensure that the service is enabled in SAP BTP cockpit.



To ensure that the *UI Theme Designer* service is enabled in SAP BTP, do the following:

1.  Log on to your SAP BTP subaccount.

2.  Select *Neo* infrastructure.

3.  In the cockpit, click *Services* in the left panel.

4.  In the *All Categories* dropdown list, select *User Experience*.

5.  Click *UI Theme Designer*.

6.  Choose *Enable* to start the UI theme designer.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you already have a subscription to the UI theme designer, you will still see the *Enable* button the first time you use it. Just click *Enable* to resolve this issue.
